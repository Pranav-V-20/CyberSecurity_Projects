# 🚨 Cybersecurity Projects 

> Elevate Labs Internship

Welcome to my cybersecurity internship project repository at **Elevate Labs**!  
This repo contains a collection of hands-on security tools, mini-projects, and research implementations I developed during my internship to explore and tackle real-world cyber threats.

## 🧠 Overview

As a **Cybersecurity Intern at Elevate Labs**, I worked on several projects focusing on:

- Web application security
- Malware detection
- Network security and monitoring
- Vulnerability scanning
- Ethical hacking and penetration testing
- Secure communications and routing

Each folder in this repository represents a separate project, complete with documentation, code, and demo/test results wherever applicable.
